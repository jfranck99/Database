Here are some dot commands you may need:

.mode column (each record is shown on a separate line with the data aligned in columns)
.header on   ( print  column labels as the first row of output)
.tables      (list of the tables in the database)
.schema      (shows the original CREATE TABLE for each table)

This would allocate 15 spaces for 3-column output. 
You may need more columns and/or  more or less space. 
.width 15 15 15 

.quit       (exit the command line interface)
